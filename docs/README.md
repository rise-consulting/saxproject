## 🚀 Technologies

Instead of starting from scratch, I preferred to climb on the shoulders of the giants, using these proven software:

- [Parse](https://pypi.org/project/parse/)
- [Jinja2](https://pypi.org/project/Jinja2/)
- [Whitenoise](https://pypi.org/project/whitenoise/)
- [WebOb](https://pypi.org/project/WebOb/)
- [Pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/)
- [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
- [Requests-wsgi-adapter](https://pypi.org/project/requests-wsgi-adapter/)

## 🏛️ Opinionated default and what's coming next

This framework come to life to resolve my problems and responde to my needs.
I use it for creating full websites in conjunction with TailwindCSS and Htmx or to make API, so all progress will revolve around this focus:

* Initial template for applications 
    * Web with TailwindCSS and Htmx, Authentication and Admin area with CRUD... 
    * API with Swagger, JWT Authentication, Rate limiting, Heatbit, Recoverer, Timeout... 

I make it available to anyone who wants to study the code, use it as is or modify it and adapt it to their own purposes. 

BUT, the development of Saxproject will continue to follow my needs and therefore feature requests and PR  will be considered only according to these principles. 

I don't expect it to be a popular or well-liked approach in communities, but the tools made available thanks to the permissive license and the principles of Open Source will allow anyone to create a fork and proceed according to their needs.
